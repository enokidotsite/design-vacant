Truly the most basic design. An example of how to load a siteâ€™s content and problematically display whatever content is available, regardless of what fields are available.

Includes [Choo](https://github.com/choojs/choo) as a front-end framework, and [Sheetify](https://github.com/stackcss/sheetify) for css-in-js.
